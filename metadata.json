  "description": "Task bar in the top panel, tasks on all workspaces, focused window title.\n\n Basic actions, nothing more : activate, minimize, switch, desktop overview. No settings but you can easily play around with CSS file.\n\n This extension hides the unneeded Activities button and makes the Places Menu extension's label become a folder icon (needs to turn off and on Simple Task Bar).\n\n This extension is light and should not interfere with GNOME Shell behaviour+logic. If you want more, please consider installing Dash to Panel. Give a try to Horizontal Workspaces + Workspace Indicator (official extensions) to get a classical setup.",
