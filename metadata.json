Some settings through GNOME Extensions manager, thanks @leleat.\n\n This extension can hide the Activities button and makes the Places Menu extension's label become a folder icon.\n\n This extension is *light* and should *not interfere* with GNOME Shell behaviour+logic. If you want more, please consider installing Dash to Panel.",
